# TetrisScraper
This was made like for only 10 minutes i haven't even tested it, So highly recommend to not use it. This was made to just give a general
idea on what could be done with [nestrisocr](https://github.com/alex-ong/NESTrisOCR). What it basically does is store the result to google spreadsheet
